        <h2>Mobile First Approach</h2>
        <p>Mobile device usage is growing by the day. This means that every site needs to adapt to different screen sizes to offer the best possible experience for the end user. In order to do this we need to think mobile first. By building from the inside out, it allows us to create a linear workflow. As devices get bigger, our styles need to adapt.</p>

          <span class="caption">As the device changes, so do our styles.</span>
        </div>
        <p>At AAI, all upcoming projects should have mobile first in mind. Because we should (and will) put so much emphasis on mobile devices at the beginning of projects we need to change how are process is handled.</p>

        <h2>Design &amp; Build Process</h2>
        <p>After we have our initial meeting(s) with our new client we're ready to start digging into the design and build of the project. In order to get the creativity juices flowing early we engage with the client first with the <a target="_blank" href="http://styletil.es/">style tile</a>. A style tile is a stripped down palette of colors, fonts and imagery that support the end goal of the finished project. What's really great about style tiles is that they're simple enough that one could quickly iterate new styles based on client feedback without having to change a number of full concept work. This approach allows the designer to gain better perspective on the overall look and feel that the client prefers.</p>

        <p>Prototyping follows soon after. Honestly, it is not directly tied to the result of a style tile so it can start once there is time in the schedule. Prototyping has really taken the place of static wireframes. It does a much better job of showing the user flow and allows for actual interaction with the site. Prototypes are also scalable. Clients can test on their phones, tablets and desktop computers. This approach also allows for us to get the site in front of clients quicker. If they have changes, we can make them in the prototype and deliver the feature in the next iteration.</p>

        <p>After the client has agreed upon a style tile version we're ready to implement these elements into a design concept. We typically create a homepage, standard content page and any other feature rich pages. This all depends on the size and complexity of the project. For instance, if we were building a staffing site we might create a (homepage, standard page, staff listing and detail page).</p>
        <div class="asset icon">
          <img src="images/design-process.png" alt="Design Process"/>
        </div>
        <p>Once the design concepts are approved we can start to implement the look and feel on top of the built prototype. Remember, with the mobile first approach we're building from the inside out. Start with the mobile size devices and build up to the desktop.</p>

        <h2>The Framework</h2>
        <div class="asset">
          <img src="images/zurb-foundation.png" alt="Foundation 5"/>
        </div>
        <p>In order to get the most out of modern day browsers, we have choosen to build with the <a target="_black" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation 5</a> framework for all projects. It gives us tremendous flexibility in responsive prototyping, customization and scalability. The community of developers behind Foundation is continually growing and improving upon the framework. Unlike other popular frameworks, Foundation keeps it's code base clean and lean. They purposely left their styles spares so themers didn't have to strip away or override baked in code. Rather, they built Foundation to be a starting point.</p>
        <h3>IE8 Needs Some Help</h3>
        <p>The last of the legacy browsers. Foundation 5 doesn't play nice with IE8, and honestly <a target="_blank" href="http://thebeatofsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/turrible.jpg">why should it</a>? With that said, we have to remedy this with some JavaScript polyfills. Simply include the following libraries in the footer of the page and IE8 will start displaying content properly.</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//s3.amazonaws.com/nwapi/nwmatcher/nwmatcher-1.2.5-min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;

&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/selectivizr/1.0.2/selectivizr-min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;

&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/respond.js/1.1.0/respond.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/local/path/rem.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>
        <span class="caption">Soon <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/end-of-support.aspx">IE8 will be extinct</a>. When that day comes we can stop implementing the above code to each site.</span>

          <h2>Getting Sassy</h2>
          <p><a target="_black" href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass is a preprocessor</a> that allows themers to quickly and effectively create complex css styles. It adds features such as variables, nested selectors, browser prefixes and loops. By taking a lot of the heavy lifting off of the themer, it allows for faster prototypes and overall quicker builds. Because Foundation is built using Sass, this gives us the ability to easily customize the framework without having to override styles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="medium-5 medium-pull-1 columns">
          <div class="asset">
            <img src="images/sass.png" alt="Sass"/>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <p>Sass also works great within our mobile first workflow. Here's an example.</p>
<pre><code>
// Change the background color as the device gets bigger

.foo {
  background-color: red;

  @media #{$medium-up} {
    background-color: blue;
  }

  @media #{$large-up} {
    background: green;
  }
}
</code></pre>
        <p>Because Sass gives us the power to nest selector and media queries, we can easily update styles as devices get bigger. Foundation provides some handy variables as well. Including <code class="snippet">$medium-up</code> only triggers when the device breakpoint exceeds the medium min width. <code class="snippet">$small-only</code> triggers only for devices within the small width range.</p>

        <p>Because there are so many advanced features that Sass offer us, people have started to create libraries to use as a starting framework. Two very popular libraries are Compass and Bourbon.</p>

        <p>Compass is really the original mixin library. It's been around nearly as long as Sass itself. It's a powerful tool and provides a couple of very useful features. First off, it has a ton of mixins to speed up your theming. Over the past few years they have been growing this list as new requests come in. The other feature Compass has to offer is compiling Sass. By creating a local config.rb file and running <code class="snippet">compass watch</code>, Compass takes a lot of the heavy lifting off of your hands.</p>

        <h3><span class="cross"><a target="_blank" href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass Mixin Library</a></span> <span class="sub">(for now)</span></h3>
        <p>Though Compass is powerful, here at AAI we do plan to move away from it. The biggest reason is that the mixin libraries are getting bloated and a lot of styles aren't needed in our workflow. Also, the compiler is slow in comparison to the lean libsass approach.</p>

        <h3><a target="_blank" href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon Mixin Library</a></h3>
        <p>Bourbon is a lightweight mixin library created by Thoughtbot. Like Compass, they have taken the time to create extremely helpful snippets to help speed up theming. Bourbon also does a better job at depreciating old mixins as browser standards change.</p>

        <h3><a target="_blank" href="http://libsass.org/">libsass Compiler</a></h3>
        <p>Libsass is a C/C++ port of the Sass engine. The point is to be simple, fast, and easy to integrate. Because it's so fast, we use it to compile our Sass files. <a target="_blank" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html">Foundation docs</a> has some simple step by step instructions to help install Foundation with libsass.</p>

        </div>
        <p><em>(Scalable &amp; Modular Architecture for CSS)</em> is more style guide than rigid framework. There is no library within here for you to download or install. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS (or in our case, Sass).</p>
        <p>By creating organization through separation, we can create easier to manage stylesheets. Because SMACSS is framework-agnostic, we can utilize this structure in Drupal, Magento, Wordpress or any other custom framework.</p>
        <p>Our structure consists of three categories:</p>

        <h3 class="folder">libraries</h3>
        <p>This contains all variables, mixing and placeholders. It can also be used to store vendor styles.</p>

        <h3 class="folder">components</h3>
        <p>This contains elements within the site. Sidebar blocks, header, footer, callouts, etc.</p>

        <h3 class="folder">sections</h3>
        <p>This category is for bigger chunks. If you were building an e-commerce site you might have sections like product list, product detail, checkout, etc.</p>

        <p>The goal is to use Foundation across all projects. This will help in situations where one developer works on a project initially and then hands it off to another. That developer should then be able to quickly get up to speed knowing that the project was built using Foundation.</p>

        <p><a target="_black" href="http://www.modern.ie/">modern.IE</a> offers a ton of useful resources for testing sites. From browser snapshots, compatibility reports and virtual machine testing. Similar to BrowserStack, modern.ie gives you access to test on an actual copy of IE8. Either in XP or Windows 7. There are several ways to install the virtual machines, but the preferred method is to use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. After you have this installed you can simply grab the IE.x curl command found on the modern.ie site and run it in your terminal window. This will download all of the box files you'll need. From here you can follow the "Getting started with VMs: Instructions" and you're ready to go!</p>
